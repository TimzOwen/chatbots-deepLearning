# chatbots-deepLearning
building chatbots basics with deep Learning and Tesorflow

We shall first learn basic python . 

get it from https://github.com/TimzOwen/python4TensorFlow.

we also get to learn the different types of chatbots and basic introduction to deep learning

# Chabot:

This is software designed to conduct a conversation or dialog.

They:

1.	Parse the user input

2.	Interpret the meaning 

3.	Provide appropriate response or meaning.

# Types of chatbot:

They are grouped according to:

	Responsive Architecture

	Conversation Domain

	Initiatives

# ON ARCHITECTURE:

1.	Rule-based Models

Chatbot are entirely predefined and return to the user exactly the set rules 

2.	Retrival –based Models

This are chatbots working almost like the rule-based models but response are pulled from existing

Corpus dialog. Introduces Machine Learning models such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and

Supervised Neural Models used to interpret user response.

3.	Generative chatbots.

This are chatbots  that are capable of generating their own response based on user input than relying on existing text. 

This involves use of Deep Learning such as LSTM-based sequence to sequence models 

# On Conversation Domain

1.0	Closed domain/Dialog 

![chatbotcustomerfocused](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34624703/77236326-970f0380-6bce-11ea-8b1f-6340aaaacb10.jpg)


Chatbot providing response within a particular focus. Such as booking a hotel, Safaricom M-Pesa or Kabarak university Mess meals.

2.0	Open domain/conversational agent

This chatbots mimic human-human conversation as they explore any range of conversation .

# On Initiatives

1.0	Mixed initiatives

The user or the bot can take the initiatives of asking or being asked questions.

2.0	System-initiative bots.

The bot takes control of all the initiatives by making the user only answer the question such as “how may I help you?” and the user

keeps answering.

# Ethics of Chatbots

Before creating any chatbot you must follow all the ethics required by the law.

	Transparency

	Chatbot persona

	Art of communication
